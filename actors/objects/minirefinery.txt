 * Mini-Refinery
 *
 * The utility-built mini-refinery is a credit flow booster. Must be built into
 * a tiberium field, in which it will start to refine the crystals there and
 * turning them into cash for you and your friends. A good thing to have around
 * when the main Refinery is destroyed. Credit flow is boosted by 75% when
 * the mini-refinery is active.
