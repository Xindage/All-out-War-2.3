* What is new about the tiberium system *

		Tiberium now reward players who don't die and also don't give to your team an absurd amount of credits.
		Continuously harvesting without dying increase the credits and experience.
		Your team does not gain a fixed amount when a tiberium is refined, now the value given to the team is divided equally among all team members, up to a minimum value if the value is too low, your own bonus increases this value as well.
		Also resigning your class don't take away your bonus, so you can freely switch from harvest to adv harvest without loss.
